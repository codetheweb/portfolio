				<p>
					TuyAPI was my first major, published entry into the world of open source. It&apos;s a collection of packages that enable the control of thousands of cheap IoT devices. Smart plugs, robot vaccums, and washing machines - TuyAPI can control them all. Although other scripts exist that allow you to flash custom firmware on Tuya devices, TuyAPI implements a reverse-engineered version of the manufacturer&apos;s protocol.
				</p>

				<p>
					I originally created TuyAPI to allow <TextLink href="https://homebridge.io/">Homebridge</TextLink> to control smart plugs, and decided to open-source it so other people could use it too. It&apos;s now by far my most popular project.
				</p>

				<p>
					Although I learned a lot about TCP protocols, encryption, and Node.js; probably the most benifical aspect for me was the immense amount of collaboration. I learned first-hand what it was like to be an open source maintainer, with all the highs and lows that come with that.
				</p>

				<p>
					There hasn&apos;t been much new development on TuyAPI for a while since the project is now fairly stable, but I still spend a decent amount of time every week replying to support-related <TextLink href="https://github.com/codetheweb/tuyapi/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc">issues</TextLink>.
